## 🚨 The Problem

Traditional restaurants rely on fragmented, manual processes that cause operational chaos:
- **Customers** suffer from slow service, paper menus without dietary context, and zero visibility into order status.
- **Kitchens (Back-of-House)** struggle with lost paper tickets, poor timing (e.g., mains arriving before starters), and untracked ingredient waste.
- **Management** lacks real-time operational insights and struggles to upsell effectively without being pushy.

## 💡 The Solution

Our Solution bridges the gap between the customer, the kitchen, and management through a **100% digitized, real-time, AI-enhanced workflow.**

## 🚀 Order State Machine

We modeled our backend on enterprise POS systems (like Toast). Orders strictly follow this flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
  Placed --> Confirmed
  Confirmed --> Preparing
  Preparing --> Ready
  Ready --> Served
  Served --> Billed
```
* **Placed:** Triggered by the customer.
* **State Transitions:** Triggered by staff. Every transition fires a Supabase Realtime event, instantly updating the customer's phone and the kitchen dashboard without a page reload.

## 📈 Scalability & Architecture Notes for Judges

- **Database Sharding:** The `restaurant_id` serves as a partition key across all major tables, allowing horizontal database scaling for franchise expansions.
- **WebSocket Efficiency:** Instead of polling, we use Supabase Realtime's connection multiplexing to efficiently handle concurrent connections per restaurant.
- **Serverless Compute:** Heavy operations (like AI prompt generation and inventory deduction) run on edge/serverless functions, ensuring the UI remains buttery smooth.
